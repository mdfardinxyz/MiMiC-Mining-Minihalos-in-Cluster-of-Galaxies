## MiMiC: Mining Minihalos in Cluster of Galaxies

### Merit Internship in Data-intensive Astronomy (MerIDiAn)

### Project Summary
Initial stage of this internship focuses on analyzing specific features within Perseus Galaxy Cluster through the production of brightness temperature maps, entropy maps, and radial profiles. The objective is to identify and interpret layers of patterns across different regions of the cluster, including the study of cold fronts — sharp boundaries within the cluster's gas that indicate dynamic interactions and cooling processes. By mapping these properties, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the thermal and dynamical structures within the cluster. The data analysis involves examining variations in temperature, entropy, and other radial characteristics to discern underlying physical processes affecting the cluster's behavior. Utilizing the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) software, we process X-ray data to enhance our analysis, providing detailed insights into the cluster’s X-ray emissions and physical properties. This foundational work sets the stage for future investigations such as the distribution of gases, potential magnetic field influences, and the dynamical state of the perseus galaxy cluster.
